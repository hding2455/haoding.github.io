## About Me
I am currently Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University. My research interests include:
- **[Robust low-level processing of surgical videos]** 
- **[Robust high-level analysis of surgical videos]**
- **[Robust Surgical Automation]**

My mission is to develop a digital twin-based framework that relies on robust low-level processing of vision perceptions to ensure the robustness of high-level surgiacl analysis and automation.
